title: Multiplayer games aren't
---

### Human-Shaped Insects

Here is my point. **The majority of people playing multiplayer games would just as happy, if not far happier, playing against decently-engineered bots.**

These bots don't need to be world-class cloud AI sponsored by NASA, either. Having bots that can find their way around environments and react fairly to stimuli is hardly a difficult problem

The structure of multiplayer games is something to envy from the position of the designer. Fast games with clearly-defined starts and ends. Cosmetics are the new grease on which a lot of this industry runs - and being able to "express yourself" via cosmetics opens up a lot of money-making opportunity. The only problem is other people.

Indeed, we might need some players mixed in with the bots

And consider the litany of problems solved by a botmatch! Matchmaking is a solved problem. The issue of latency is immediately halved. No queue times. No hackers, no cheaters. No concerns with toxicity -- bots only say the n-word if specifically instructed to (or if you train their language ML against Quake Live players, I suppose).

No smelly other players to consider. Just you, some optional buddies, some epic loot, thrilling gunfights and awesome cosmetics.

### Dehumanized

This shouldn't be the case, make no mistake. A compstomp here and there is fun enough, but there is no obstacle as fascinating, rich and exciting as another human's mind. However, in the multiplayer scene, we seem to have flocked towards games that treat us like bots. Battle Royales are bot games - why else would you need 60-100 motherfuckers in a game with you? Matchmaking systems gut the whole idea of community from multiplayer games - these things either crystallize around things like streamers/youtubers (a very dangerous thing, I feel), 

### It's Already Happening

Ravenfield was almost invented to prove my point. 

Dead by Daylight is my favourite multiplayer game. It is comically simple in terms of mechanics, it has one of the most player-hostile unlock systems I've seen in quite some time and it was more or less engineered to be streamer-bait -- regardless, it is a multiplayer game that actually feels personal.

Fighting games are probably the only genre of game I don't play but hold massive respect for, and are relatively innoculated against this. Fighting games understand the importance of community.
