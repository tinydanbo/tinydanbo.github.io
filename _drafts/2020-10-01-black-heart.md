title: Black Heart

*Black Heart from "Battle Garegga" is the best STG boss ever designed. Hate the rank system all you like, hate the bullet graphics as you please, but any game seeking to challenge a player and leave a real impression could learn a thing or two from Black Heart.*

### Roadblock

Black Heart represents a roadblock, twice over, and for different reasons. Her first appearance is a fairly sedate boss fight - however, it is at the end of a short boss rush, just before when the game really takes the kid gloves off, and in the exact stage where your rank-related sins will catch up with you. "Rank" is shorthand for Garegga's infamously tyrannical dynamic difficulty system, which requires careful consideration of powerup usage and demands frequent sacrifice to be satiated. If you have done a bad job of keeping that devil happy, this is the point where you'll be punished for it. This first fight is simply an attempt from the game at kicking the unworthy off the machine, and if you conquer it, you prove that are to be taken seriously.

Her second appearance, however. A revised form. Movements are yet more erratic, attack patterns even more intense and chaotic. This time, you're not being judged or speedbumped, you're being annihilated. Doing well against Mk.I means finishing with enough resources to penetrate stage 6 (read: A Lot Of Fucking Resources) -- doing well against Mk.II means surviving by even a hair's breadth and a real shot at beating the final boss, who can be comparatively a bit of a paper tiger if you can hold your nerves. But, you've been taught the basic function and rhythm of this boss in Mk.I - this is, *merely*, an escalation.

All this alongside the fact that players just naturally love to see a boss's triumphant, patched-up return[^1], and it's little wonder that Black Heart is a name that players both curse and adore.

### Duel

Another of the reasons Black Heart is so compelling a boss fight is that, well, it's a duel! Black Heart moves quickly and erratically like a player might, has attacks that are both defensive and utterly offensive in nature, her signature attack doesn't look too far from what might pass as a smart bomb. She even has a "hitbox", in effect - all areas of the ship but the core being impervious to damage! No extraneous parts to damage, no control over her attacks and no cheap shots. The craft isn't some weird gigantic ball, tank or manta ray, it's a simple, pointy stealth bomber - looks like a scaled-up version of something the player may pilot. This mass of black and red passes pretty well for a rival, and she goes offensive while every other boss plays defense.

Black Heart does not really have conventional, rigid boss phases. There are a few showstopper attacks and maneuvers, but it mostly mixes and matches two from a chocolate box of attacks - an aimed stream of shots, fans of bullets, cages of glowing flak. Some attacks must be shot down by the player - splashy clusters of grenades, red bullets, seeker drones. This random, hodgepodge selection of attacks actually lends the fight a real sense of give-and-take. There are points in the boss fight where you seek to milk score, and points where you're simply trying to stay alive. Sometimes shit gets really devious, and you're forced to keep your medal chain up while dodging, and sometimes Black Heart will just flex on you by parking itself all the way down the screen to trap you between her thrusters. Some of these ad-hoc patterns give great opportunities to deal damage, others bully the player from a firing angle as the boss thrusts and thrashes to further frustrate the aim. It may be the hardest few minutes in Garegga, but it's still remarkably well-paced. 

The scoring potential of Black Heart only makes it all the richer a boss fight. All that invulnerable armor is fodder for "tick" points, all of her splashy bombs and seeker drones are lucrative fodder if you can keep pace and have the resources. The stakes are truly high, and most players will generally find they can score at least one extend during the fight, which may prove to be a much-needed second wind. Play it right and this black heart may become your black diamond.

The chaotic, "duel"-feeling nature of this fight is a great foil to the rest of the game's bosses - which are generally about slowly picking apart a big war machine in the most lucrative way possible.

### Right, Left, Right, Left

Let us speak of the vulcan trap now. "Vulcan trap", while descriptive enough, simply does not do such an iconic attack justice. I'd have called it something dumb like "BLACK METRONOME". It is honestly rather rare for bosses to have a signature attack like this, and every Garegga player in the world knows to fear and respect this one attack. 

It is, simply, a bullshit attack. 

You must memorize a very strict position on the screen and a yet-stricter "right, left, right, left...!" timing that corresponds with that position - the wrong position fouls the timing. Most of the game's smart bombs will fail to protect you from this attack. If stuff like this attack appeared any more than it already does, Garegga would be a trash game, and rightfully so. But this attack, and specifically the Mk.II version, is the game's dramatic climax. Strict as it is, it can be learned, anticipated and dodged like anything else. It is the part of the game where, when dodged for the first time, Morpheus looks over your shoulder and says "he's beginning to believe". There is only one other game I can think of that has such an unreasonable, iconic difficulty spike which serves this purpose - Ketsui's reverse-scrolling descent section. The vulcan trap is stricter than even that, and yet -- dodge it consistently, amidst the enormous pressure this game places upon you, and you have nothing to fear any more. This black heart is broken, and you may claim your 1CC.

The infamous fake-out at the end of Battle Garegga and resulting pathetic, unhinged desperation from the last boss is extremely good too, but Black Heart is the star of the game in both of her appearances. [One of the best boss themes in videogames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwAXcw1yOaA) might as well be her theme. Making bosses and their bullet patterns was one of the few things I built real confidence in, but every time I look at Black Heart and all the amazing things this one boss does, it's obvious that I still have so much to learn!
