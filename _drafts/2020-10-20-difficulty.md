title: My problem with difficulty
---
It seems very unfashionable to even have an opinion on difficulty settings these days. Every so often, some bloody website posts a "Dark Souls 45 Must Have An Easy Mode" opinion piece, and most folk pretend to discuss the topic by screaming truisms at each other until the collective discourse passes. I simply must immediately consign Twitter to a "application for looking at Himura Kiseki illustrations" role, but it's hard, man.

Ultimately, my problem with difficulty settings is that they are both too blunt a tool and used for several competing concerns at once.

I present two different use cases for difficulty settings, though there are obviously more. One is "ability based" - difficulty settings being there to adapt the game for variations in a player's ability - due to genre literacy or a lack thereof, heightened or degraded reflexes/cognition, mental/physical disability. Players who have every advantage should be guided towards a harder setting, whereas the less advantaged are guided towards an easier one. The ideal being that all players of all ability levels and have access to the same experience.

The second case is "experience based", where the difficulty setting governs the experience one has with the game. Whether a game is a weekend one-and-done or something the player must slowly learn and hopefully enjoy over time.

The former is eternally noble. The latter, while understandable for as long as games are consumer products, makes me leap across the room in disgust.

My old blog was quite hit-and-miss (In one old, embarassing post), but one shitpost I quite enjoyed was advocating an "action mode" for Spec Ops: The Line. For some reason I wrote it as a parody of *A Modest Proposal* and though 

But in any case, regardless of one's opinions about these two cases or any others, these are radically different problems that require radically different types of design.

My favourite video game of all time is *Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi*, and referring to it in this full romaji makes me feel like I'm kneeling before a king clad in mojibake. It took me **years** to accomplish a sloppy 1-ALL of Ketsui, albeit at a fairly slow, casual pace - despite being someone that is generally competent at action games and who knows what an STG is. 

I achieved this first 1-ALL on my first international travel, which was to Tokyo - a dream I had in itself since I was 8 years old, tears of happiness were streaming down my face on my first flight ever at 27 years old, how pathetic. I achieved this clear on a pristine Egret III in Taito HEY in the heart of Akihabara, when I probably should have been looking at cherry blossoms or something. My first paycheck after I got my degree went to a J-360 so I could play Ketsui, and it was the Blue Revolver money that put me on that plane. What would it have meant without the prior years of loving play?

I want everyone to feel something like that, though I admit the context is hard to match. I have become both disillusioned that execution difficulty in video games is an efficient tool for accomplishing this, and that if that experience was an option next to "play for a weekend and forget about it in order to consume more content", most people would choose the latter.

[^1]: In my ripe old age, I now consider the fact that we can rely on prior knowledge of video games as something that broadly props up good game design and allows for much of the design space to exist in the first place. I'm sorry that it's so hard for people to pick up games from scratch and that the mainstream is now looking even more inward and obtuse than the indies, but I feel it beats a great many alternatives.
