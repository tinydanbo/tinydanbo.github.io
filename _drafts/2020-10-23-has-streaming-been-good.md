title: Has streaming been good?
---

Some silly cringe from a bald man today

This notion is, obviously, silly, short-sighted. Streaming is heavily transformative. If this is doing the damage you are saying it does, you are going to be asking for *a lot* of money from people who - well, big streamers are doing pretty good for theirselves, but they can't prop up your industry, and mid-tier full-timers are barely paying rent anyway. How do you enforce this?

You can probably just leave it there. But the defense against this thought has been illuminating. There is an unspoken assumption something like:

> The streaming industry has been great for games. It is free, extremely effective marketing done at long hours.

Yeah, but has it been great for *all games*? Two points from which I draw a conclusion:

Streaming is -the- discoverability method now. Discovering games through storefronts is stupid. Big game journo places are stretched thin to cover all the ever-increasing minutae of modern AAA games, and can barely keep up when it's time to talk about whatever game is doing the rounds on streaming. Editorial youtube videos, "video essays", are things created with such inexplicable passion for craft that they take months to produce in the service of something that people largely fall asleep to. *Sorry.*

Streaming has had a massive, indelible impact on the field of game design. Battle Royale games grew in popularity *because* they happened to have all the qualities a streamer would want in a game - long periods of fairly low impact gameplay, queueing, looting etc, during which chat may be interacted with, interspersed with short, sharp shocks of high-stakes, high-drama gameplay. Other genres that fit these metrics: Action roguelites, Minecraft, and *ah fuck that's all the games that are doing well right now!* Even games that do well out of left-field like Phasmophobia (doing well meaning "providing enough money for the developer to live on", which is not exactly the standard position).

With these two in mind, surely the conclusion is obvious, which is that **if your game isn't built for streamers, this environment is dicking you over**. Here is how to optimize your game for Twitch:

* Don't fucking put in any cool textures like FIREBLU.
* Put in a slot-machine element of some kind[^1]. Loot, crits, perk pools. Streamers love reacting to the big wins and complaining about the bad runs.
* Have a game structure conducive to pouring in shitloads of hours. Unlocks, character building, etc etc. We all know how this particular sausage gets made.
* Pace the game not around who's playing, but who's performing around it and who's watching. An intense 25-minute arcade game with no chaff or filler is great to play, but absolute *gash* for a Twitch stream unless, perhaps, you're a superplayer currently on WR pace.

If you don't want to do this, well, you can suck a lemon and hope a game journalist sees something bright enough in your game to go against every material force pulling them away from it. Word-of-mouth among players will always be there, and always appreciated, but it's 6pt Times New Roman compared to the loud and sexy 72pt Helvetica word-of-mouth a streamer offers.

Streamers aren't even in a position to resist this force. They need material to react to and riff off, they need novelty, they need downtime and drama, they need the space in which they may do what the ancient gods once called "Twitch acting". And hey, good for them, no beef. 

Time for the type of rhetoric I absolutely despise. If you disagree with this conclusion, here is your rough position: *The massive collective playtime/viewtime of "Fall Guys" on Twitch is because it is just ten times, a hundred times, perhaps a thousand times a better game than everything else. Don't think about it too much.*

Bear in mind, this isn't a departure from a neutral playing field. Before streamers, the sorry crown of kingmaker was on the heads of game journos. We all know what a journalist-bait game looks like, just like we know what a streamer-bait game looks like. STGs are left out in the cold in both cases, so I don't really care much.

Perhaps this landscape is better for games as a whole, one could easily make that case, but it certainly hasn't been good for everybody.

I asked myself today what the point of making new video games is, a question that's been dangling over my head for a long, looong time. The physical process of coding them *sucks*, they don't exactly make people happy, I am endlessly cynical about the reasons people play them - briefly touched on that cynicism here. Self-expression is a strange notion when you feel empty. I do think I finally found an answer I was happy with, though. It is, unfortunately, stupid, so I won't share it.

[^1]: Do you think I didn't notice that the age of the Twitch streamer is the same one where everyone started complaining about something called "RNG" to my eternal chagrin?
