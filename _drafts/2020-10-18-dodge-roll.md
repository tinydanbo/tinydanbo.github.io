title: It is now time to cool it with the dodge rolls
---
*Dodge rolls, iframe dashes, call them whatever you like - they are becoming a bit too familiar in action games, and they're starting to make games feel both dumber and more samey.*

I recently played Hades. A very pretty game with some interesting ideas which is wise to make Greek mythology cool again (the second-best of all classical mythologies to base a game off, short of Touhou Project), but also one of those mildly detestable action roguelites filled with enough meta-progression mechanics that the game represents *Cookie Clicker* - a version in which "click the cookie" is replaced with "play a 30-40 minute run with a build that probably didn't synergize and probably isn't what you wanted", mind. I think there is a growing audience that would really like to do away with all that stuff (perhaps "not everyone has the time or interest to spend 20+ hours unlocking everything so they can play the game with everything available" is a concern that we should be looking at alongside assist modes and accessibility options!), but that's not what I'm here to bitterly complain about, natch.

Of course, naturally, the two must-have boons (perks) out of the whole lot are the two which directly augment your dash ability's defensive capacity - either giving you more dashes, or allowing you to reflect attacks back at enemies with dashes, on top of their generous allocation of iframes. Is this not a familiar design pattern? Remember *Cuphead*, where you'd have to be a very silly child (or at least not in on the joke) to not pick the "blink dash" upgrade immediately?

When it all comes down to "press button to not die", this has a very dumbening effect. Most of the properties of an enemy's attack don't matter beyond the basic timing, and now we are left with games resembling a very slow 1-button rhythm game. It doesn't matter how close or how near the player is, or the area they're fighting in. In the end, it feels like the best games can do is give everything awkward-looking animation fakeouts and intense tracking. *Dark Souls 2 sure was incredibly ahead of the curve on this one, huh.*

I don't even think dashes are great as a mobility mechanic, as imprecise as they are.

### Readability

Back to Hades. How "readable" an action game is has become a thorny topic for me. I have read people talk about Blue Revolver saying there are few games that do a better job of being readable, and others that say it's deeply flawed in this aspect. Given that identifying elements, threats, attacks, etc is so obviously part of the learning curve of a game (and, here I so softly whisper to you, *part of the challenge*), there's always to be a spread of opinions anyway - really, it's down to how an individual person interfaces with an individual game, and it's often very hard to say anything particularly objective in this aspect.

But hey, there's no harm in recognising where a game does itself no favours. It's funny to me when a game has art that is so good and rich in detail that the eye has trouble distinguishing what's worth looking at, though this game is also based on the core conceit of every button you press inflicting different status effects, buffs, debuffs, etc. If the game is able to get away with this, it is because of the invuln dash. If you can't tell what's going on so well, mash space and you're probably going to be okay. It does seem like the invuln dash is allowing for some sloppy visual language here. When the defensive option is so strong and so one-size-fits-all, we are free to pollute the screen with a million effects and stack up a thousand overlapping threats.

### Samey

When so many games are taking this exact approach to defensive mechanics, the result is a lot of rather samey-feeling games. When more and more games rely on a single, tired, sloppy defensive mechanic, and when [boss fights by their nature bring defensive play into focus]({% post_url 2017-10-03-no-skip-button %}), is it any wonder people hate boss fights? People were quick to start to complain of "big guy with 3 hit combo" bosses in FromSoft games, which is an excellent illustration of how samey everything starts to feel in the world of iframe dodge rolls.

There's more of a case to be made for this design in a 3D game. The camera can only see so much, depth perception is an issue. It is not trivial to navigate complex 3D environments at the best of times, and having to do so defensively, with precision and under duress - is expecting a lot. But in a modern top-down 2D game, where we have a perfect bird's eye view of the action, it's fine to expect players to make better use of positioning, to actually physically get out of the way of whatever we're throwing at them.

As far as strictly defensive mechanics go, consider how much unique flavour Sekiro got from the parry system, which was hardly even a radical change to the "press button to not die" system. Stricter timing, no sloppy all-in-one of movement and defense. Good defense worn down the enemy's posture as much as good offense, and if you've truly downloaded the enemy, predicting specific attacks with specific counters lets you push them all the harder. A truly iterative change, and yet it made for a very unique feeling game in a subgenre that was starting to feel a little stale.

I don't mean to rag on Hades, it's easily Supergiant's best game. Stay safe. I'm not doing so well. I have finally been assigned to some sort of formal mental health treatment, which so far has been about 90% having a nurse read a series of CBT leaflets to me, 5% VOIP call issues and 5% actually getting to talk with a professional about the, hm, 6 things that are fucking my head up every day. Oh well, stay the course.

I am trying to write a little more since it's currently easier than the alternative ways of expressing myself. Tune in next time for my shocking potential expos√© on how action roguelites are wholly cursed objects that practically no gamer has ever truly wanted.
